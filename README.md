# Project Structure
- src/main/java/placementApplicationTracker: Contains the source code of the application
- src/test/blackbox/specificationBased: Contains the test files for specification based testing and bash script to get it's coverage
- src/test/blackbox/randomBased: Contains the test files for random based testing generated by Randoop
- src/test/whitebox/branchBased: Contains the test files for branch based testing and bash script to get it's coverage
- src/test/whitebox/statementBased: Contains the test files for statement based testing and bash script to get it's coverage
- src/test/whitebox/mutationBased: Contains the test files for mutation based testing
- jacoco-0.8.11/lib/: Contains all jacoco related jar files
- jars/: contains all project related jar files
- junit-platform-console-standalone jar: Jar file used for coverage 

# Setup and Installation
- This project contains all the jar files used in jars/ folder
- Configure the build path by adding all the jars to the class path.
- Right click on the project folder in eclipse -> Build Path -> Configure Build Path -> Click on Classpath and Add External JARs -> Now Add all the jar files in jars/ folder
- Apart from the jars/ folder, we also need to include other jar files to the classpath. These are 'junit-platform-console-standalone' jar file present at the root of the project folder and the jacoco jar files which are present in 'jacoco-0.8.11/lib/'.


# Running the application
- To run the application, navigate to src/main/java/placementApplicationTracker/App.java
- Now Right-click -> Run as -> Java Application
- Credentials to test: Student Login ID (Student Id: 1, Password: 123), Admin Login (Admin Id: 1, Password: admin_password)

# Running Tests and Coverage
- Navigate to src/test/blackbox/specificationBased/ folder
- Right click on the test file -> Run as -> JUnit Test
- For checking mutation coverage in Eclipse, install Pitclipse in Eclipse. Go to mutationBased folder, then Right-click -> Run as -> PIT Mutation Test 

# Generating Coverage
- Navigate to the folder you want to generate coverage
- To generate coverage,
                        -> go to Terminal to the folder location to which you want to generate coverage
                        -> execute 'chmod +x bash_script.sh or bash_script.bat'
                        -> execute './bash_script.sh or .bat'
- A report folder must be created. Now open index.html to View the coverage.
- Please ignore the mock folder and test folder in the coverage
